# open-diablo-editor

========
Overview
========

This is an MIT-licensed Diablo editor, written in Java. At present it is very primitive. I uploaded the code due to a request from mewmew (see official forum thread at http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/thread-16344.html).

At present it is usable but will require a little knowledge of Java coding. In a future revision (or revisions) I will add a GUI.

Credits/Acknowledgements
========================

The mod workshop located at http://www.thedark5.com/info/mod.html has proven to be extremely valuable in the construction of this software.

The workshop was originally created by Charlie with assistance from Jarulf.

A big thanks to Zamal & Zenda for continuing to host it, and not letting it disappear.
