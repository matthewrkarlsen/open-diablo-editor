# Open Diablo Editor (ODE)

## Overview

This is an MIT-licensed Diablo editor, written in Java. At present it is very primitive. I uploaded the code due to a request from mewmew (see official forum thread at http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/thread-16344.html).

At present it is usable but may require a little knowledge of Java.

## Quickstart

- Install Java 1.8 (from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- Set your JAVA_HOME and add Java 1.8 to your PATH variable
- Install Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Bring up a command prompt for the folder where you want to store the code
    - In Windows, shift + right click in an explorer pane then select open prompt
- Run "git clone https://github.com/quixotic-cynic/open-diablo-editor.git"
- Enter the OpenDiabloEditor folder and bring up a new prompt
- Run "gradlew createReleaseJar"
- Move the resulting jar from .../OpenDiabloEditor/build/libs to your Diablo folder
- Run the JAR with the command "java -jar open-diablo-editor-0.0.1.jar" (changing the version as appropriate)
    - Diablo.exe will remain unchanged
    - A new DiabloModded.exe will be created
    - No other files will be changed
    - If the DiabloModded.exe exists, ODE will load that in preference to the Diablo.exe
- Enjoy (hopefully)
- Send me comments
